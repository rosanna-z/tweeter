# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. With it's responsive design, it is compatible with various screen sizes while the navigation bar is fixed at top. When a user composes a tweet, there is a live character counter with action icons that changes colour when the user hovers over the icons. If a user submits a valid tweet, the list of tweets is refreshed and displays in reverse-chronological order.
